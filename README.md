Conway's Game of Life
===

A simple 'Game of Life' implementation written in AngularJS 
(http://angularjs.org/), JavaScript and HTMLS. It includes implementations 
of common still lifes, oscillations and spaceships (see 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life for more information).

Bootstrap (http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/index.html) is used for 
styling and some automated unit tests are implemented using QUnit
(http://api.qunitjs.com/). Underscore (http://underscorejs.org/) is also
used for some checks.
